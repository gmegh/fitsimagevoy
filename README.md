## About FitsImageVOY

The name FitsImageVOY refers to the Voyager series of Star Trek, the successor of DS9 (Deep Space Nine), after which SAOImageDS9 was named. DS9, a space station in the Star Trek universe, marked the beginning of a transformative journey into the cosmos. As the successor to DS9, the Voyager series continued this legacy, venturing into uncharted territories and inspiring generations of astronomers and space enthusiasts. SAOImageDS9, a powerful astronomical imaging tool, inherits its name from this iconic series. FitsImageVOY, drawing inspiration from SAOImageDS9, follows in the footsteps of DS9 and the Voyager series, contributing to the ongoing saga of cosmic exploration in the realm of data visualization for astronomers and researchers.

FitsImageVOY is dedicated to the Rubin observatory scientists who will discover the questions of the next 50 years. Learn more about the groundbreaking [Rubin Observatory](https://www.lsst.org/) project.
